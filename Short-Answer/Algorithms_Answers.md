#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Should be O(n) because n increases at the same rate of the iterations.


b) Should be O(n^2) because of the nested loop the iterations will increase at the number of iterations squared.


c) Should be O(n) because there is 1 iteration for each n

## Exercise II

We would do a binary search. Take n and find the midpoint, if an egg gets broken off of that floor then make that n. Do this until we find the floors that are the divider and return the bottom floor, the highest floor where the egg doesn't break.

The runtime of the complexity would be O(n/2).
